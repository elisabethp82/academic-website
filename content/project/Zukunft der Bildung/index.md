summary: The school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that Austria has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to digitizing schools. On the one hand, there is a need to make up for lost ground in terms of infrastructural equipment and the provision of digital learning materials that have been prepared in a didactically meaningful way. On the other hand, however, both teachers and learners lack the skills to use them.
In the project "Future of Education in the Context of Digitization and Equal Opportunities", strategy recommendations for the future of education in the context of digitization and equal opportunities in Austria are being developed on the basis of theoretical research and data analysis as well as surveys of key stakeholders.
