summary: "Comprehensive digitization in all areas of life requires corresponding knowledge and skills in dealing with digital media. The COVID 19 pandemic has shown that Austria has some catching up to do in terms of digital education and that - like Europe as a whole - it is still a long way from digital sovereignty. On the one hand, there is a need to catch up in terms of infrastructural equipment and the provision of didactically appropriate digital learning materials. On the other hand, however, both teachers and learners lack the skills to use them.  
Therefore, digital literacy must be developed systematically and consistently by all educational institutions, embedded in appropriate technical resources. Competencies such as information procurement, digitally supported cooperation and critical reflection on sources will replace the reproduction of knowledge.
In the project "The Future of Education in the Context of Digitization and Equal Opportunities", strategy recommendations for the future of education in the context of digitization and equal opportunities in Austria are being developed on the basis of theoretical research and data analysis as well as surveys of key stakeholders."
