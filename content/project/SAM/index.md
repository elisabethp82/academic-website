summary: The goal of the project "Studierende zum Abschluss motivieren" is to support students, especially in the final stage of their studies (writing the master's thesis). For this purpose, workshops for teachers were designed, conducted and evaluated according to the train-the-trainer approach, teaching them measures for direct and indirect motivation and self-regulation support.
