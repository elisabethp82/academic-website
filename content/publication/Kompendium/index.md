abstract: "Motivation, especially intrinsic motivation, is considered an important
factor in successful learning. Students are often assumed to have a high intrinsic motivation for their studies - after all, they have chosen to study at university! In reality, however, we know that motivation can vary greatly depending on the situation and that it is often and it is often necessary to raise and maintain it in a targeted manner.
Teachers can support your students in this process by considering a few basic points in the design of their courses and also by teaching their students techniques to positively influence their motivation in a positive way."
