	abstract = {Self-regulated learning refers to consciously controlling one’s own learning process in order to achieve a specific, previously selected goal. Especially the subarea of metacognition is considered an important prerequisite for learning success. The foundations for the development of competencies for selfregulated learning should already be laid in school and, in the sense of lifelong learning, be further differentiated in continuing education and at universities. This paper presents a train-the-trainer program in which university teachers acquire competencies that enable them to systematically implement the promotion of self-regulated learning in their teaching. The materials described can also be used in student advising and in the design of continuing education measures in adult education.},
