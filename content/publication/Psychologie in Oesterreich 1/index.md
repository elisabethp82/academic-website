abstract: "Self-regulated learning refers to consciously controlling one’s own learning process in order to achieve a specific, previously selected goal. Especially the subarea of meta-cognition
is considered an important prerequisite for learning success. The foundations for the development of competencies for self-regulated learning should already be laid in school and, in
the sense of lifelong learning, be further differentiated in continuing education and at universities. This paper presents a train-the-trainer program in which university teachers acquire competencies that enable them to systematically implement the promotion of self-regulated learning in their teaching. The materials described can also be used in student advising and in the design of continuing education measures in adult education."
