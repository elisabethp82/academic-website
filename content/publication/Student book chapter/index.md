abstract: "As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a lockdown was imposed in Austria, as part of which universities were also closed. To assess the impact of these measures on students’ well-being and learning, we conducted three surveys between April and June 2020 (MP 1: N = 6074, MP 2: N = 5551, MP 3: N = 2047). Based on Ryan and Deci’s (2000) self-determination theory, we examined the fulfillment of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and social relatedness as factors influencing well-being and intrinsic motivation (e. g., Milyavskaya & Koestner, 2011). An additional focus of the study was on self-regulated learning, since a dis-tance learning setting requires increased self-regulation. In this chapter, the key findings are presented, discussed, and recommendations for action for higher ed-ucation are derived."
