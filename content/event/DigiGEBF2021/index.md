abstract: "The rapid switch to digital learning during the COVID-19 crises put groups that might be disadvantaged in the virtual classroom at risk. Studies indicate gender differences in the use of technologies and related skills, with boys potentially having an advantage over girls in the online classroom based on their higher perceived ability, comfort and engagement with computers.
Perceived self-efficacy influences learning engagement and intrinsic motivation in the context of digital learning. Moreover, competency beliefs and self- efficacy, values and intrinsic motivation may be influenced by environmental support which may be even more important in digital learning. Previous studies also found that learning motivation, engagement, and perception of social support may vary with age. It is therefore critical to investigate gender differences as well as the role of age in digital learning during this fundamentally altered situation in student’s lives."

summary:  How do gender and age influence students' ability to cope with the sudden shift to digital learning? Do boys have an advantage because - as is usually assumed - they have a greater affinity for technology?
