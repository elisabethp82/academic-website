abstract: "The workshop <i>How can we best support doctoral candidates?</i> focuses on
the motivation and self-regulated learning of PhD students. For the successful
completion of a doctorate (and also for a possible further scientific career)
early stage researchers need to be able to motivate themselves and to have
the competence to organize, structure and evaluate necessary tasks within the
framework of the doctorate on their own. However, the great autonomy and
the responsibility for the own doctorate can trigger excessive demands and
cause motivation problems. Anxieties can lead to a pessimistic evaluation of
one’s own competencies (“I can’t do it!”, “Others are much better than I am”)
or of the work itself (“I don’t know why I am doing all this!”, “Is it really worth all
this effort?”). Supervisors are faced with the challenge of how to best motivate
doctoral candidates and strengthen competencies for self-regulated learning."
