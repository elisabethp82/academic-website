I am a PhD candidate in Educational Psychology at the University of Vienna. My research interests include self-regulation, motivation, and well-being in academic contexts. I love learning new things and challenging myself - this is evident in my work, but also in my free time, where I like testing my limits in running, swimming, and cycling. I also love helping others achieve their goals, which is why I enjoy teaching and am studying to become a personal trainer, triathlon coach and yoga instructor.
