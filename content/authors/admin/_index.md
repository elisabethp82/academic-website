I am a PhD student in Educational Psychology at the University of Vienna. My research interests include self-regulation, motivation and well-being in academic contexts. I like challenges and learning new things - in my work but also in my spare time. I have a lot of different interests and hobbies (knitting, spinning, reading but also running and triathlon), some of which I only do for fun and relaxation, some of which I like to challenge myself and strive to get better in. I also love supporting others in achieving their goals, which is why I like teaching. This is why I am also training to be a personal trainer, triathlon coach and teach yoga.
